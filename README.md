### About:
A script to extract three-photon absorption (3PA) data from Dalton output files.

This script has been tested on output files (``.out``) obtained using Dalton v.2018-2020 and
might not work on output files obtained using earlier versions.

### How-to:

``python ./extract_3pa.py OUTFILE_NAME.csv WORKDIR_PATH``

WORKDIR_PATH: where i) the Dalton output files are located and 
ii) the csv output file will be created, e.g., ``./`` or ``./results/``
